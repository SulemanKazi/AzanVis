# AzanVis
Visualize Azan locations around the world using kepler.gl and compute stats. The output from the 
Azan_Kepler_Vis_One_Day notebook is used by Azan_All_Days_Select_Cities so the former needs to be run first.

For more details about the project, see the [project page](https://sulemankazi.github.io/projects/azan).
